# Shoulders
# This file has the raw data for the shoulders study.  Each row is one stimulus/task.  Each volunteer performed three tasks.  The volunteer number is in col 1.  The stimulus abbreviation is in col 3.  There are three stimuli: EUB is the EU Banking regulations, CIDN is Curious incident of the dog in the nighttime, and BSc is the black/blank Screen.  Columns 8 to 15 are summary data for a given movement.  Col 8 is the mean distance from the screen horizontally (X- direction), while column 9 is the mean distance from the floor.  Distances are in cm.  Column 10 is the mean "two dimensional speed" in mm/sec at 1 Hz.  Data points from a lateral camera (in X,Y coordinates) are translated into mm in the X,Y plane, then every second the Euclidean distance is calculated between adjacent samples to determine a speed.  columns 22 to 34 are subjective ratings of VAS (0-100) rated by the volunteer at the end of that task.  The columns are ratings for the descriptors: 22 interest, 23	engagement, 24	boredom, 25	frustration, 26	see_more,	27 end_earlier, 28	Detached_Apathetic, 29	Cared_About_It, 30	Did_Not_Pay_Attention, 31	Tired_Drowsy, 32	Arousal, 33	Valence, 34	Dependence
